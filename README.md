## Reflection

The Test-Driven-Development approach did not come naturally to me at first but after writing and passing the first few tests using Jest it started to become really satisfying seeing all the green check marks appear. Having to first write unit tests for all of the factory functions before building anything really pushed me to start planning and thinking ahead more than I had in the past. This was the first time I actually wrote anything down physically to try and visualize what each component was meant to do. Overall this project likely took the longest for me to complete but consequently was the most satisfying to see in its finished state. I would still like to implement a working AI for the computer player but I'm happy with how this turned out.
